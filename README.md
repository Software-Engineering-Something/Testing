# Testing
Unit tests
We use a company data file to test accuracy and machine learning from Python's KLearn library. Check the percentage of errors and mean square errors. After everything works as expected. We modified the project to work with multiple files at the same time and we tried the project with 3 different data files but still the same industry and tested the results.

System tests
After the project has worked effectively with 3 files. We started testing all the files in an industry and seeing how the results were disputed after running KMean library machine learning.

Acceptance tests
After everything worked, we look for the data and limited errors that MSCI expected to see if the data we output matched the MSCI conditions and criteria.
